## Sprint 0

Nov 12 - 16, 2020

Sprint 0 was a 3-day mini-sprint we did during our onboarding. It gave us the opportunity to dive into our project charter as defined by our government partner (ESDC) and start working towards a solution as a team. 

## Sprint Goals
- Begin making connections with allies and stakeholders. This could include people who have experience working in government, people at the ESDC, and anyone who has done related work.
- Do research on the problem space, such as Rules as Code, NLP, and OpenFisca
- Brainstorm ideas for blog posts related to our project
- Begin identifying the personas that will be the users of the product that we deliver
- Create a slide deck and deliver a presentation to our government partner to show the work we've done so far 

## Deliverables
