## Sprint 1

Nov 23 - Dec 4, 2020

## Sprint Goals

### Establish connections with allies
  - BDM team within ESDC
  - People who have worked with OpenFisca
  - People who have worked with NLP and government rules

### Research
  - Familiarization with OpenFisca: We began the sprint with this goal in mind, but then soon realized that this research on the specific technology was premature. We still have more important work to do in identifying users and further extracting concrete products from the project charter.
  - Begin exploring the potential users of the PDE: We met with people who work in EI to begin the process of building out user stories and personas.

### Set up communication
  - Officially introduce ourselves to ESDC: Created an intro video to introduce both C4C teams to ESDC. The goal is to provide a quick way for anyone at ESDC to familiarize themselves with who we are and the distinction between the two teams.
  - Set up a Wiki page containing important info about project and team: Completed for now. Still investigating the optimal platform for the blog
  - Publish an article describing the work we may be doing: Completed.
