This is a list of resources  related to the concept of Rules as Code (and Computational Law)

## Concept

### What is Rules as Code
- Approach to developing rules designed to improve policy outcomes
- Sometimes synonymous with computational law
- Can involve multidisciplinary teams drafting rules in both natural language and code at the same time
- It is a general principle that can have many applications: Contracts, organizational policies, board games, etc.

### Background
Traditional models of creating, managing, and improving government rules (policy, legislation, regulation, etc) were developed for a non-digital environment. This can result in mismatch between intent and implementation (sometimes called the implementation gap).

Much of the work around RaC emerged from the New Zealand Service Innovation Lab, headed by Pia Andrews. They ran experiments that brought programmers into mock legislative drafting processes.

### Benefits
- Removes ambiguities from unclearly written rules
- If it is machine-consumable, then we can take advantage of automation and computers
- It is easier to change rules. If the RaC are encoded in software, we can run tests to measure simulations on the potential impact of the change

### Legal considerations
RaC is closely aligned with the concept of [Legal Formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_formalism), which is the idea that laws should be clear and uncontroversial, so they can be applied unscrupulously. This is in contrast with legal realism, which permits arbitrary discretion in legal judgment to balance interests of affected parties on a case-by-case basis. 

This means that RaC may be more relevant in a civil law context, where laws are taken more literally. It is less relevant to common law, where judicial innovation is the norm. This is an important consideration. Computational law is only as powerful as deductive reasoning in general, but in reality, laws are more complicated than this and open to interpretation.

### Ethical Considerations
Since we are modelling humans, we need to be conscious of the data we use to build the model and also the data that we **omit** from the model. If we leave out some important piece of data when modelling humans, we risk ignoring certain groups.

3 Weeks exploration to identify opportunities and challenges of creating human and machine-consumable rules for effective service delivery.

Important findings:
- It is difficult to produce machine-consumable rules if policy has not been developed with this output in mind
- Not all legislation is suitable for Rules as Code, but a multidisciplinary approach can assist in making clearer rules

Questions and next steps:
- Identify legislative barriers to data and digital transformation to inform development of standard clauses
- Work closely with other D7 countries: Canada, Estonia, Israel, New Zealand, South Korea, Uruguay, UK

## Blawx example

Blawx is a free open-source web tool for encoding rules, created by Jason Morris. It is based on blockly, which is descended from MIT's scratch:

## OpenFisca

[OpenFisca](https://github.com/codeforcanada-babel/main/wiki/openfisca) is an open-source platform for building RaC engines.
