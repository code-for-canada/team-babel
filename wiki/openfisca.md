French population is affected by tax changes, inherited from regular legislative changes. It's hard to evaluate means and proposals before passing law. Impacts and revenues are often discovered too late. Wanted a tool to verify costing support and verification the correlation between the political vision and the impacts of the population.

LexImpact is an interface that makes it possible to estimate the impact of parametric reforms (currently limited to income tax). It is based on OpenFisca. The tool was used during a debate on a finance bill in 2020. 

Two interfaces:
- OPEN LexImpact: can estimate impact of reform on tax households
- POP: estimate macro impacts of a reform on the population and state revenues. This is currently only accessible to parliamentarians and admins

Next goal is to pursue continuous improvement within national assembly and to evaluate extending the service to other parts of the law.

Digital tech is transformative but takes longer to transform govt services. Existing legislation can be a barrier to digital service transformation. This project experiments with using machine-consumable legislation.

API [Library](http://nz.openfisca.org/) that lets you explore and call legislative rules
