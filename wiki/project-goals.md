This page outlines the background and high-level goals of the work that we will be doing over the course of the fellowship. 

## Background

The ESDC delivers programs to many clients (old age security, CPP, EI, student loans, RESPs, etc). These programs are subject to laws and policy, some of which date back decades. To ensure compliance, the ESDC has operational guidelines and directives on how to handle applications and claims. In many cases, this guidance is unclear, conflicting, and outdated. Making changes in one place can have unintended consequences elsewhere, and it is hard to predict how a change to a program will affect people.

The ESDC has begun a transformation project to change how it delivers benefits. The goal of the Benefits Delivery Modernization project (BDM) is a multi-year long initiative to modernize tools and processes that deliver important social benefits to the public. This project fits in with the initiative.

It is also important to note that the department is experiencing significant changes due to the Covid-19 pandemic, so there is an ongoing need to support efficient legislation and policy development.


## High-Level Goals

### Long-Term Vision
Incrementally develop a solution that will allow us to detect changes to rules and predict impact on clients/society/operations, which will help identify policy gaps and priorities for policy changes, as well as potential improvements and automation. This general tool can be referred to as a 'Policy Difference Engine' (PDE).


### Product Delivery
We will be facilitating progress on this project in order to accelerate digital transformation in government by showing what's possible. There is a focus on delivering a concrete product that addresses an urgent need that can be used and tested by staff. While the delivery of the product as outline in the charter is not fixed, fellows will work on a roadmap, refine the design, and prioritize components of the project. A deadline for deliverables is August 21, 2021. 

The purpose of this project is to improve policy and service agility. There are no hard and fast target dates, instead, the plan is to test and use the tools together as they are developed to provide supporting analysis to other transformation initiatives.

### Building Digital Capacity
The fellowship will build digital capacity in government by helping to familiarize public servants with modern digital methods and tools through delivery and training. This involves creating a smooth transition and hand-off to the ESDC at the end of the fellowship.

The fellowship team will work as a dedicated, self-empowered team following agile principles. Fellows will use modern design and development and processes throughout their residency. They will conduct user research and develop iteratively, and will make their work as open and transparent as possible.

By showing what is possible through prototyping, the work done by the fellows will serve as a use case for future work at ESDC. The goal is to create processed that can be replicated once the fellows leave. In order to enable product sustainability, fellows will make choices that will enable their product to be maintained by the government after they complete their fellowship. This means taking cost, government capacity, and training needs into account when making a selection.
